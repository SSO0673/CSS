My CSS Projects

This repository showcases my journey in developing my CSS skills. Each project in this repository represents a step forward in my understanding and ability to create engaging, responsive, and visually appealing web pages using CSS.

## Projects

1. Motivational Meme Site: This project allowed me to explore the power of CSS in creating engaging content.

2. Colour Vocabulary Site: This project is a colourful exploration of CSS and its ability to bring language learning to life. The site features a vocabulary of colours in Spanish, providing an interactive and engaging way to learn.

I'm excited to continue expanding my CSS skills and adding more projects to this portfolio. Stay tuned for more!
